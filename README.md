# Chatly - Instant messenger

⚡ Use chatly to message your friends, family and loved ones.

(Not really, but if enough people use it, I'll probably reach the free firebase limit😂. This project is part of my software development portfolio.)

## Why?

Hey, I am Alwin Sunil [(@alwinsunil)](https://github.com/AlwinSunil), a front-end developer. Started working on Chatly with the intention of building a top-notch chat application to advance my craft and build my portfolio.

## Contributing

I haven't planned to make this an open project, since it would be a dumb idea because there are much better options available eg - Signal.

But if you are interested to work on this project for fun and to learn,
Pull requests are welcome. Please open an issue to discuss what you would like to change for significant changes.
